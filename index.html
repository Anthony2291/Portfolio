            <h1>Hello, I am Anthony Rodriguez</h1>
            <p>Student with Thinkful based out of Phoenix, AZ.</p>
            <p>I am still new to coding, but I am loving it. Some of my other interests include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Comic books, reading and watching shows or movies based off of them.</li>
                <li>Video games, I own every console but mainly play on my PC that I built.</li>
                <li>Hanging out with my dog, he mostly just likes to go on walks.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>About Anthony</h2>
            <p>My work background is in customer service, I started working my senior year in highschool and have had a
                few service jobs since then. I also went to a community college while I worked, but I never knew what I
                wanted to major in.
                I finished my prerequisites that I needed and tried to decide on a major but I couldn't. It wasn't until
                I started doing some free coding courses when I finally decided what I wanted as a career.</p>

            <p>Now I am currently learning web development with Thinkful, and I am liking the challenge it brings as
                well as hopeful to where it will lead me.</p>
